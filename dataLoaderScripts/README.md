term_extract.py:

Run this script to extract required information from the GO file containing GO ids, GO term, ontology

This script requires the GO file as input and generates the data for GO table.

prepareCAFAIds.py:

Run this script to get a file with proteins with their CAFAId tragets.

Takes 2 swissprot files(earlier and later version) as input files and outputs data required for Protein table.

prepareProtein_GO.py:

Run this script to get a file which connects the indices in Protein and GO files generated by the first 2 scripts.

Uses Protein, GO as reading files and generated data required for Protein_GO table.

prepareEvidence.py:

Run this script to genearte a file containing Protein_GO indices mapped to evidence code and the year in which it was
associated with that protein.

Uses protien, old mapping, new mapping, Go, Protein_GO as reading files(from earlier step) and generates data required for insertion in Evidence table.
